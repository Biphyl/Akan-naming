        <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such 
          as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding
          his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they
          were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender. These
          Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, each child 
          is born with a name associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore 
          determined by the soul. The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan’s
          was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people’s attention as they 
          desire to know more about these names. As a matter of fact, it is possible to tell 
          what led to someone’s birth, the day they were born and their rank among the siblings
          just by their names. </p>
        <p>The naming of children in all Akan societies, as it is 
          believed that the name given to a child can affect his behaviour and destiny. 
          Besides, the family name that is given to the child the day the child is born 
          is very significant as it actually becomes the first name of the person.
